This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in C++ when iterating over a `std::vector`.  The incorrect code attempts to access an element beyond the valid range of indices, leading to undefined behavior. The corrected code shows the proper way to iterate using `<` instead of `<=` when comparing the index with `.size()`. The code also uses `size_t` for the loop counter to avoid potential integer overflow issues.
